								<p>Old Dominion (4-3) defeated Temple women’s basketball (2-5) 77-65 at Chartway Arena in the Anne Donovan Classic.</p>
								<p>While the game was close during most of the action, a 10-point run by Old Dominion helped extend their lead to 17 with 5:40 left in the game, which seemed to put the game to rest.</p>
								<p>Temple’s first half featured poor shooting as the team was 11-34 from the field. It was not much better in the second half as, by the end of the game, the Owls shot 20-57, including 5-19 from three-point range.</p>
								<p>Foul trouble was the main theme for the Owls as four players, including three starters, had at least three. One of these players was sophomore guard Jasha Clinton, who fouled out with 3:42 left in the game. The last time she fouled out was against USF January 22.</p>
								<p>She finished the game with 10 points, two rebounds, and nine turnovers.</p>
								<p>Similar to other games this season, the Owls were out-rebounded as they grabbed 30 while Old Dominion had 46. One of the contributing factors was not boxing out, which allowed players like Old Dominion junior guard Jordan McLaughlin to get eight rebounds, her career high.</p>
								<p>“We have been trying to work on our rebounding all season,” Temple head coach Diane Richardson said, “and that’s been an Achilles heel for us. They got a lot of second chance points, and we have to be a lot better at boxing out and locking down lanes.”</p>
								<p>Senior guard Aleah Nelson led the Owls in scoring with 16 points but struggled with efficiency as she shot 6-14, including 2-6 from beyond the arc.</p>
								<p>Graduate guard Jalynn Holmes played well, scoring a career-high 12 points while grabbing four rebounds and three assists.</p>
								<p>“Jalynn has done a great job just being everywhere in the games,” Richardson said. “She’s rebounding the ball, she’s getting shots, playing, defending, and covering their best player, so she’s doing whatever she can for the team.”</p>
								<p>Old Dominion graduate guard Makalya Dickens led the team in points with 18, a season-high for her. She was 5-9 from the field, with all but one shot coming from the three-point line. Dickens also grabbed six rebounds, three assists, and three steals.</p>
                                <p>Despite playing only 17 minutes due to fouling out early, senior forward Amari Young played a crucial part in the team’s success. She scored a season-high 16 points while grabbing six rebounds and three steals.</p>                       
								<p>Temple (2-5) will return home to UMBC (2-4) at the Liacouras Center on Saturday, December 3, at 3:30 p.m.</p>
