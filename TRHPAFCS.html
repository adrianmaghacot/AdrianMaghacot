								<h2>Two Owls Gets Noticed from the American and NCAA</h2>
								<p>After the Owls’ 54-28 dominating win over USF, a few Owls were recognized for their outstanding performances.</p>
								<p>Redshirt sophomore running back Edward Saydee was named as the Doak Walker Co-Running Back of the Week alongside Kansas freshman Devin Neal. He was also one of five players to be named to the Week 10 conference Honor Roll.</p>
                                <h2><a href="https://owlsports.com/news/2022/11/8/football-edward-saydee-named-doak-walker-co-running-back-of-the-week">Saydee Named Doak Walker Co-Running Back of the Week</a></h2>
								<p>Saydee had the game of his life, torching the Bulls for 265 rushing yards, 69 receiving yards, and three rushing touchdowns. The rushing and all-purpose yards are ranked fourth and fifth-most in Temple football history.</p>
								<p>“Right now it hasn’t hit me yet but I know it will later on,” Saydee said. “Right now, I’m focusing on getting my body right and moving on to Houston.”</p>
								<p>Graduate kicker Camden Price was recognized by the conference as well, being named the Week 10 Special Teams Player of the Week. Price scored four field goals, which was the first time a Temple kicker had a 4+ field goal performance since current Denver Broncos kicker Brandon McManus in 2010 against Villanova.</p>
								<p>He also was 6/6 on extra points, which increased his total to 18 points. Those 18 points marked the most points scored by a Temple kicker in program history and any AAC kicker this season.</p>

								<p>“That’s awesome to hear and I look up to Brandon and he’s had a great NFL career,” Price said. “Glad the offense got it together and put me in the position to score.”</p>
								<h2>What the Future Looks Like for the Owls</h2>
								<p>Next season will look very different and not only for the Owls, but the entire conference. In June, AAC Commissioner Mike Aresco announced the finalized entrance agreements for six schools to start playing against the nine continuing members in 2023. Those six teams are UAB, North Texas, Charlotte, Rice, FAU, and UTSA.</p>
								<p>Despite almost doubling the number of teams, the American will not have a divisional format during this time period as only the top two teams in the standings will face each other in the championship game.</p>
                                <h2><a href="https://theamerican.org/news/2022/11/9/american-announces-football-scheduling-model-for-2023-26-seasons.aspx">American Announces Football Scheduling Model for 2023-26 Seasons</a></h2>
								<p>Three teams the Owls will not face however are Cincinnati, UCF, and Houston, who will not return as their contracts were terminated after being unanimously approved to join the Big 12.</p>
								<p>Temple also announced its four non-conference games for the 2023 season. The Owls will play Akron (September 2nd), Norfolk State (September 16th), and Miami (September 23rd) at Lincoln Financial Field and Rutgers on September 9th at SHI Stadium.</p>
