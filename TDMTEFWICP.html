                                <p>Temple (6-7, 1-0 AAC) defeated Memphis (8-6, 0-1 AAC) 80-69 in its first conference game on Friday at the Liacouras Center.</p>
								<p>While the game started very slow for the Owls, they surged in the second quarter behind a 21-3 run as a result of senior guard Aleah Nelson‚Äôs 11-point quarter.</p>
                                <p>‚ÄúI had to tell myself to keep shooting the ball,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúI mean I didn‚Äôt even realize I was 0-3, so I kept saying to myself to shoot the ball.‚Äù</p>
                                <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Q2| Can you say 19-2 run?üî•üî• <a href="https://twitter.com/aleahnelson_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@aleahnelson_</a> <br><br>Temple 43 | Memphis 33 <a href="https://t.co/Nj9mR4jzku">pic.twitter.com/Nj9mR4jzku</a></p>&mdash; Temple Women‚Äôs Basketball (@templewbb) <a href="https://twitter.com/templewbb/status/1608913084973973504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
								<p>This was also the first game sophomore guard Aniya Gourdine played this season. The former All-AAC Freshman team player finished with eight points, one rebound, one assist, and one steal.</p>
								<p>‚ÄúEverybody was coming out of COVID, so we had to move a lot of people around,‚Äù Temple head coach Diane Richardson said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been off the court for a while and she was dying after two minutes. They carried the weight for us‚Äù</p>
								<p>The momentum in the first half shifted in both directions with Memphis taking advantage of the first quarter by out rebounding the Owls 15-7 and shot an efficient 41.2%.</p>
								<p>However, Memphis was much more careless in the second quarter by turning the ball over four times and fouling seven times. Temple took its first lead of the game with 4:10 left in the half. Memphis also scored only three field goals, which led to the Owls outscoring Memphis 30-11 in the quarter.</p>

								<p>Very similar to the first half, the momentum shifted between both teams in different quarters.</p>
								<p>Temple came out of that run continuing their dominance out scoring Memphis 23-16, including limiting the team to only six field goals. In the fourth quarter, almost every player on the Memphis roster besides three players scored at least a point and sophomore forward Tiarra East led the Owls during the quarter with six points.</p>
								<p>Memphis forward Shelbee Brown and Temple‚Äôs Gourdine both received technical fouls with 42 seconds left in the game. Both players were arguing during a Memphis free throw and were subbed out after the attempts.</p>
								<p>Nelson had a career game, leading the Owls with 20 points, six assists, and a season-high eight rebounds. Sophomore guard Jasha Clinton also had a productive day after tying her season-high of 17 points. Junior guard Tarriyona Gary had a season-high of her own with five assists.</p>
								<p>‚ÄúI think we pulled it out and we did a great job pulling this one out in our first conference game,‚Äù Richardson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the second season and they really stepped up.‚Äù</p>
								<p>Memphis senior guard Madison Griggs led the Tigers in points with a season-high of 20. The team had two freshman players who had dominant games rebounding the ball. Guard Tanyuel Welch had a season-high in both rebounds and assists with 11 and five, respectively, while center Destiny Thomas had a season-high of eight rebounds.</p>
                                <p>Memphis will return to Tennessee to face East Carolina (10-3, 0-0 AAC) at Elma Roane Fieldhouse on Tuesday, January 3, at 7:00 PM.</p>                                                             
								<p>The Owls will start the new year off traveling to Tampa to face off against South Florida (11-4, 0-0 AAC) at the Yuengling Center on Tuesday, January 3, at 5:00 PM.</p>
