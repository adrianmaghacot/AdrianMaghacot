								<p>Temple football hosted its annual Cherry & White spring game at Edberg-Olson Hall Saturday in front of an enthusiastic crowd of Owls supporters.</p>
								<p>Several big names were in attendance, including current Bills linebacker Tyler Matakevich, NFL free agent Matt Ioannidis, and men’s basketball head coach Adam Fisher.</p>
								<p>The day consisted of different game-like scenarios. First-string players took the field first, followed by second-string players, then third-string players for live scrimmaging. This pattern continued throughout each drive and/or scenario.</p>
								<h2>Drive-By-Drive</h2>
								<p>-Defense leads 3 to -1 (drive ended with a sack)</p>
								<p>-Defense leads 11 to 5 (drive ended with a Camden Price 41-yard field goal)</p>
								<p>-Defense 15 to 11 (drive ended with a Sam Martin Jr. interception)</p>
								<p>-Offense 22 to 15 (drive ended with a touchdown pass from EJ Warner to Landon Morris and PAT by Camden Price)</p>
								<p>-Offense 33 to 15 (drive ended with a touchdown pass to Tyler Douglas to Shakuna Kamara and PAT by Chris Van Eekeren)</p>
								<p>-Offense 40 to 15 (drive ended with a touchdown pass from Darvon Hubbard to Amad Anderson Jr. and PAT by Camden Price)</p>
								<p>-Offense 40 to 19 (drive ended with a missed field goal by Chris Van Eekeren)</p>
								<p>-Offense 43 to 21 (drive ended with a field goal by Camden Price)</p>
								<p>-Offense 50 to 21 (drive ended with a Darvon Hubbard touchdown and PAT by Chris Van Eekeren)</p>
								<p>-Offense 53 to 23 (drive ended with a field goal by Camden Price)</p>
								<p>-Defense leads 11 to 5 (drive ended with a Camden Price 41-yard field goal)</p>
								<p>-Offense 64 to 23 (drive ended with a touchdown pass from EJ Warner to Zae Baines and PAT by Camden Price)</p>
								<p>-Offense 65 to 25 (drive ended with a Dante Atton punt)</p>
								<h3>–Offense 65 to 28 (drive ended with a turnover)</h3>
								<p>Official scoring stopped after the completion of the first half, meaning the official final score of the game was Offense 65, Defense 28.</p>
								<h2>Who Stood Out?</h2>
								<p>After the event, head coach Stan Drayton and six players spoke to the media:</p>								
                                <h3>E.J. Warner</h3>
                                <h3>David Martin-Robinson</h3>
                                <h3>Jordan Magee</h3>
                                <h3>D’Wan Mathis</h3>
                                <h3>Jalen McMurray</h3>
                                <h3>Demerick Morris</h3>
								<p>Below are excerpts of their sessions.</p>
                                <h3>Drayton on the goals of Cherry and White Day:</h3>
								<p>“It’s another opportunity to get better as a football team, and we can’t take that for granted. We didn’t show a whole lot schematically but we still came out and we hit and we tackled. That’s something that showed up today in a positive light…We got done what we needed to get done.”</p>
								<h3>Drayton on Warner’s development over the spring:</h3>
								<p>“E.J. has had a phenomenal spring. He continues to grow as a person and is becoming a leader. He’s got a lot of people following him right now, and I think he’s handling that very well…He’s our guy and we’re rallying behind him.”</p>
								<h3>Warner on his first college spring practice season:</h3>
								<p>“It was so much fun. Being with those guys for 15 days this spring, playing the sport we love, that’s why we came here. Have a ball, talk trash, make plays; it’s been good…It’s been really good, I’m having a great time, and I love those guys.”</p>
								<h3>Warner on his improvement this offseason:</h3>
								<p>“I think definitely leadership. I think coming in last year as a young guy, I didn’t try to use my voice too much. I tried to earn that respect through my play. I think these guys respect me now because I’ve put in the work and put in the time and we can come out here and they’ll listen to me.” </p>
								<h3>Graduate tight end David Martin-Robinson on the development of the tight ends:</h3>
								<p>“We’ve got a bunch of young guys in my room [tight ends room] that want to learn and want to be on the field, so that makes it a lot easier when you’re talking to them.”</p>
								<h3>Demerick Morris on former defensive coordinator D.J. Eliot’s departure:</h3>
								<p>“Coach Withers is a really good defensive coordinator, and there was really no drop off from it. Once we got the news that he got the promotion, we congratulated him and didn’t flinch.”</p>
                                <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
								<p>The Owls will play Akron in their season opener Sep. 2 at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>
