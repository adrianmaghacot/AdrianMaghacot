								<p>Despite not hearing their names called during the draft, five former Temple football players received opportunities to earn an NFL roster spot.</p>
								<p>Each was a member of the Owls during the 2022-23 season and participated in Templeâ€™s Pro Day in April.</p>
								<p>The following players all either signed as an undrafted free agent (UDFA) or received a minicamp invite:</p>
								<h2>Jose Barbon (WR) â€“ UDFA, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
								<p>Barbon led the Owls in both receptions and yards last season, hauling in 72 receptions for 918 yards and two touchdowns. He played all four of his collegiate seasons at Temple and finished his career with the fifth-most receptions in program history with 138. During the schoolâ€™s pro day, Barbon ran a 4.47 in the 40-yard dash, which placed him in the top-20 in terms of receivers who were at the NFL Scouting Combine.</p>
								<p>Barbon is the only Owl from the 2022 team to sign an NFL contract this offseason.</p>

								<h2>Isaac Moore (OL) â€“ Minicamp Invitation, Green Bay Packers</h2>
								<p>Moore was one of two five-time letterwinners on the roster, starting in 2018 as a true freshman. Moore was one of seven single digits, given to players who lead by example on and off the field. This past season, Moore broke former Owl and current Orlando Predators safety Delvon Randallâ€™s school record for most consecutive games played with 57.</p>
								<p>Moore had a busy offseason. He received a mini-camp invite Apr. 29 from the Green Bay Packers, which gives him an opportunity to land on the roster. He was drafted to the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League May 2. He was previously drafted to the Philadelphia Stars of the USFL in February.</p>

								<h2>Adonicas Sanders (WR) â€“ Minicamp Invitation, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
								<p>Sanders played three seasons at Georgia Tech before transferring to Temple for the 2022 season. The Charleston, SC, native set career highs in receptions (37) and receiving yards (437) in just nine games last season. He became the first transfer since Rock Ya-Sin in 2018 to be named a single digit.</p>
								<p>Sanders received an invitation to attend the Indianapolis Colts mini-camp on Apr. 30. A strong showing could land him an NFL contract with the team.</p>

								<h2>Xach Gill (DL) â€“ Minicamp Invitation, New York Giants</h2>
								<p>Gill played three seasons at North Carolina before transferring to Temple for the 2021 season. He missed the 2021 season after suffering an ankle injury in the spring. He recovered and played in all 12 of Templeâ€™s games in 2022, earning a career-high 24 tackles (nine solo, 15 assisted).</p>
								<p>Gillâ€™s hard work and determination throughout the season caused head coach Stan Drayton to award him a single-digit Nov. 25.</p>
								<p>The New York Giants sent Gill an invitation to attend their mini-camp Apr. 30, allowing him to give his NFL dream a shot.</p>

								<h2>Adam Klein (OL) â€“ Minicamp Invitation, Washington Commanders</h2>
								<p>Klein was another five-year letterwinner and starter on Templeâ€™s offensive line. He was voted by teammates as one of the teamâ€™s five captains and also received an honorary single digit this past season.</p>
								<p>The Washington Commanders invited Klein to attend their mini-camp May 1.</p>

								<h2>What's Next?</h2>
								<p>The NFL mandatory minicamps take place during the first three weeks of June. Rookie minicamps vary but typically last two-to-three days during May. Here, the former Owls will have a chance to compete for the 53-man rosters before teams make cuts Aug. 30.</p>
								<p>As for the Owls, they will continue summer workouts before opening their season against Akron on Sept. 2 at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>
