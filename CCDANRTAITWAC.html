								<p>The Owls (7-8, 2-1 AAC) defeated Cincinnati (7-8, 0-2 AAC) 77-73 Saturday at Fifth Third Arena behind strong performances by sophomore guard Jasha Clinton and senior guard Aleah Nelson to earn their second win in conference play.</p>
								<p>Nelson blossomed against her former team as before transferring to Towson and Temple, she played at Cincinnati as a freshman, averaging 1.3 points and 9.6 minutes per game.</p>
								<p>During her homecoming outing, Nelson finished the game with 20 points, three assists, and three rebounds.</p>

								<p>Clinton helped control Templeâ€™s first half, scoring 16 points, one point shy of her season-high in one game, on 6 of 9 shooting. The team also held Cincinnati to a 30.3% shooting percentage during the first half, including limiting junior Jillian Hayes, the teamâ€™s leading scorer, to only four points.</p>
								<p>In the second quarter while Nelson was struggling, Clinton provided a spark to the Owls by scoring 13 of the teamâ€™s 20 points during that quarter, including contributing to a seven-point run. One of their biggest successes was Temple taking advantage of Cincinnatiâ€™s 4 of 14 shooting to then feed Clinton the ball.</p>
								<p>While Cincinnati only scored 11 points during the quarter, senior guard Jada Scott made a buzzer beating shot at the free throw line to give the Bearcats some momentum into halftime.</p>
								<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jada Scott beats the buzzer! ðŸš¨<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CHOICES?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CHOICES</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkindonuts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dunkindonuts</a> <a href="https://t.co/7htmMBH8PY">pic.twitter.com/7htmMBH8PY</a></p>&mdash; Cincinnati Women&#39;s Basketball (@GoBearcatsWBB) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoBearcatsWBB/status/1611811839494737921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
								<p>Despite Temple replicating their performance from the first half by shooting 50% in the second, Cincinnati shot much better and attempted to mount a comeback after halftime, thanks to a 52% team shooting percentage and a seven-point third quarter by Hayes.</p>
								<p>With 39 seconds left in the game and Cincinnati down by eight, Hayes fouled out and the team was without its leading scorer with an opportunity to tie.</p>
                                <p>After a personal and technical foul by Clinton, Cincinnati scored the following three free throws and forced a turnover, but Temple sophomore forward Tiarra East grabbed a rebound and made her two free throws after being fouled with four seconds left.</p>                       
								<p>Cincinnati freshman guard Aâ€™riel Jackson then made a three-pointer at the buzzer, but it was not enough, giving Temple the four-point win.</p>                       
								<p>Clinton scored a career-high 28 points and tied her season-high of six assists. East captured her second double-double after scoring 10 points and grabbed 10 boards.</p>

								<p>Jackson led the Bearcats with 19 points and junior forward Malea Williams and Hayes each grabbed eight rebounds.</p>                       
								<p>Cincinnati will travel to Texas to play SMU (10-5, 1-2 AAC) at Moody Coliseum on Tuesday, January 10, at 8:00 PM.</p>
