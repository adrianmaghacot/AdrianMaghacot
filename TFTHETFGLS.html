								<p>Due in part to one of the team’s largest scoring droughts of the entire season, Temple women’s basketball (10-15, 5-8 American Athletic Conference) fell to Houston (11-14, 8-4 AAC) 56-48 at the Liacouras Center.</p>
								<p>Houston used a full-court press the entire game, which stopped the Owls from crossing halfcourt numerous times. While Temple shot 30% from the field, Houston had a worse time shooting the ball, shooting 25% from the field.</p>
								<p>Redshirt senior guard Britney Onyeje led the charge for the Cougars, scoring 15 points, as well as grabbing seven rebounds, two assists, and two steals.</p>
								<p>Temple senior guard Aleah Nelson led the team with 13 points on 4-13 shooting while grabbing seven rebounds, seven assists, and one steal.</p>
								<p>Temple struggled in the first quarter, scoring their first point with 4:02 left after sophomore forward Caranda Perea made one of her free throws. 30 seconds later, redshirt junior Brittney Garner scored the Owls’ first field goal with a layup.</p>
								<p>“Basketball is a game of runs, and we saw that in the first time we played Houston,” Temple head coach Diane Richardson said. “If we get down 13-0, we got to still fight.”</p>
								<p>Houston had a scoring drought of their own, making zero field goals for the last 6:51 of the quarter, but managed to keep their 14-8 lead into the second quarter.</p>
								<p>Despite trailing by double digits in the first quarter, Temple tied it back up at 16 with 5:28 left in the half after a euro step by Nelson. Unlike the first quarter, Houston was unable to get a rhythm going, making four field goals in the entire quarter.</p>
								<p>However, Houston fought back and went into half with a 23-20 lead.</p>
								<p>Similar to their first matchup, Houston had a strong third quarter, scoring 19 points with 10 of those coming from Onyeje. Temple, however, struggled and scored 11 points and trailed the Cougars by 11.</p>
								<p>In the fourth quarter, the Owls had a few of its players foul out. With 2:18 left in the game, Garner picked up an offensive foul driving in the paint and received a technical while on the bench. Less than two minutes later, sophomore forward Ines Piper picked up her fifth with an intentional foul.</p>
								<p>In addition to Onyeje, junior guard Laila Blair also scored 15 points, but struggled with efficiency after going 3-of-18, including 3-of-13 from beyond the arc. Blair also had five rebounds, two steals, and one assist. Graduate forward Tatyana Hill was a force on the team’s defense, grabbing 11 rebounds, five steals, and three blocks.</p>
								<p>Temple junior guard Tarriyonna Gary scored 11 points on 3-of-14 shooting as well as grabbing seven rebounds, five steals, and two assists. Perea had her career-high in rebounds with 13 and season-high in blocks with two, respectively.</p>
                                <p>Piper had six blocks, which is the most by a Temple player since 2016. Piper also made three rebounds and three assists.</p>
                                <p>“I don’t really try to block shots and it’s just a reflex,” Piper said. “I don’t really think, ‘oh she’s attacking the basket’ and I just block her shot.”</p>
                                <p>The Owls will travel to Orlando to face off against UCF (11-13, 2-10 AAC) for a second time at Addition Financial Arena on Tuesday, Feb. 18 at 6 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN+.</p>
