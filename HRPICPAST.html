                                <p>Houston, led by 20 combined kills from outside hitter Abbie Jackson and middle blocker Isabel Theut, beat Temple in three straight sets.</p>
								<p>The Owls traveled to Houston to start the second half of their season facing the #23 Cougars (20-2, 10-0 AAC), who proved to be too powerful as the team dominated in all facets of the game.</p>
                                <p>It was the second time this month the Owls faced a nationally ranked team after facing #24 UCF on October 14th. This is the first time the Cougars were ranked in the AVCA polls since 1994.</p>
                                <p>Temple outside hitter Taylor Davenport started off the first set with a kill, but Houston responded back with two from Theut.</p>
								<p>Since switching to outside hitter this season, Davenport blossomed and she currently has 346 kills and is second in the American Athletic Conference in kills per set with 3.85.</p>
								<p>Theut is equally as dominant offensively as Davenport with 3.84 kills per set, including 146 in conference matches, and recently reached 1,000 career kills.</p>

								<p>The first set was primarily back and forth, but after Houston started a few runs, they pulled ahead and ended the set with a 25-18 score after a kill from Jackson.</p>
								<p>The second set was very similar in terms of the low point differential, but Temple outscored Houston 7-2 late after multiple service aces from Davenport and setter Magdalena Rogalska.</p>
								<p>However, it was too little and too late for the Owls as Houston outside hitter Kortlyn Henderson secured a kill to finish off the set with a 25-20 score.</p>
								<p>In the third set, the Cougars went on multiple three- and four-point runs, which led to the team leading by double digits throughout the match.</p>
                                <p>Those Houston points did not all come from attacks as some resulted from many errors, with three from right-side hitter Peyton Boyd.</p>
								<p>The Owls came back from the seven point deficit, with kills from many players on the roster, but Houston closed out the match with a kill from Henderson with a 25-13 score.</p>
                                <p>The Owls struggled throughout the match as they led a combined three times, with two occurring at the beginning of the first two sets.</p>
								<p>This is the sixth match this season where the Owls were swept and this loss dropped them to nine losses in conference play.</p>
								<p>For Temple: Davenport led the team in kills and attacks with 7 and 29, respectively, but also led in total errors with 10.</p>
								<p>For Houston: Theut contributed to most of the teamâ€™s success with the aforementioned 10 kills, 21 attacks, and two blocks. Jackson also performed well during the game with 7 digs, 27 attacks, and scoring 11 points.</p>
								<h2>Score by set: (18-25), (20-25), (13-25)</h2>
								<p>Temple (8-14, 2-9 AAC) will continue their conference away schedule and face Tulane (8-14, 3-8 AAC) at Avron B. Fogelman Arena in New Orleans on Sunday, October 30th, at 12:00 PM on ESPN+.</p>
